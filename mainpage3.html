                  <p >The ‘Rasmancha’, located at Bishnupur is probably one of the most underrated architecture not only in
                       Bengal but in the whole of India.This edifice was built in the year 1600 with the commissions by 
                       the king of Mallabhum- Hambir Malla  Dev, also popularly known as Bir Hambir. As the name suggests
                        , the Rasmancha was established to celebrate the ‘Ras’ festival, during which each  and every
                         ‘Radha-Krishna’ idols from all other temples in Bishnupur would be brought here for a public 
                         exhibition .Placed on  a raised square laterite base , the Rasmancha has a pyramidal structure. 
                         The beautiful temple which is 24.5m in breadth and 12.5m in height , includes within it three 
                         successive circular galleries. The arches of these galleries are beautifully decorated with 
                         terracotta lotus motifs . Surveys have revealed that this style of architecture is unique and 
                         cannot be seen anywhere else in India.

                     uninhibited in their imagination and creativity. Though the art of creating glazed pottery has been in 
                     existence for thousands of years in India, the unglazed pottery items are the ones India is world 
                     renowned for. Terracotta items are commonplace in Indian homes in one form or other, and artisans have 
                     kept the art alive from one generation to other. Today, India exports exquisite terracotta items like 
                     statues, vases, decorative hangings and bells, murals, Diwali oil lamps, etc. making the art form a

                    Indian terracotta sculptures are filled with beautiful stories and they are rich in culture. 
                    Terracotta sculptures in India started during the the Indus valley civilization period. Stones and
                     metals were difficult to procure during those ages. Most artifacts in India are made by terracotta. 
                     If you have visited Indian temples, all the sculptures on the walls were made by terracotta ages ago.
                      Most mythological deities and their vehicles were made using terracotta. Mythological stories were 
                      conveyed to the masses using these terracotta sculptures. Nowadays terracotta is used for creating 
                      decorative items used for festivals like Navaratri and in pottery, which can be used as interior 
                      decorative items.

                  <p>
                    At a distance of 1 km from Jor Mandir Temples and 2 km from Bishnupur Bus Station, Kalachand Temple 
                    is an ancient temple located in Bishnupur, West Bengal. Situated near Radha Madhav Temple, it is one 
                    of the must-visit places in Bishnupur as part of Kolkata Tour Packages.

                    Built-in 1656 AD, the marvelous Kalachand Temple was built by King Raghunatha Singha in the Ek-Ratna 
                    architectural style with laterite stone. Dedicated to Lord Krishna, this is the last and the oldest 
                    of the laterite structures in Bishnupur. The temple stands on a square platform and the shrine is 
                    surmounted by a shikhara on a sloping roof. The frontal facade contains bas-reliefs depicting scenes 
                    from Krishna Lila, Puranas and contemporary life. This Ekaratna temple is enclosed by a double 
                    compound wall in bricks now in ruins. Sadly, the temple does not house any deity currently.

                    <p >
                      Madan Mohan Temple built by Durjana Singh Dev King in the late 17th century is a clear symbolization 
                      of Bishnupur's eternal bond with stone and terracotta temples and worship of various gods and 
                      goddess of Hindu mythology. Its Ekaratna style of architecture with square flat roof, curved 
                      cornices and a pinnacle atop has helped it earn the status of the finest terracotta temple of
                       Bishnupur. Dedicated to Lord Madan Mohan, an incarnation of Vishnu, the temple cannot skip the 
                       eyesight of devotees and also leisure tourists. The spread out terracotta artwork on the majestic
                        pillars depicting various scenes from Hindu epic Ramayana and Lord Krishna's life are brilliant 
                        examples of craftsmanship of artists of the those years. The amalgamation of brick and terracotta 
                        tablets imposed walls come alive with these beautiful pictorial depictions on them.
