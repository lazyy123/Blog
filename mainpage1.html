      <p>The Terracotta Warriors are life size terracotta sculptures created more than 2000 years ago to be buried with Emperor Qin Shi Huang,
         China's first emperor. They were discovered in March, 1974 by farmers who were digging a well in the Shaanxi Province, about 0.99 
         miles east of the Emperor Qin Shi Huang's tomb at Mount Li in China. The construction of the Terracotta Warriors began when the Emperor
          took power. He was only 13 years old, and spent much of his life searching for immortality. His massive tomb encompassed 20 square miles, 
          and thanks to the work of more than 700,000 laborers, his underground tomb included more than 8000 warriors, and many other sculptures to 
          protect him and entertain him in the afterlife.</p>

      <h4 class="media-heading">TERRACOTTA POTTERY</h4>
        
      <p>Terracotta is the type of clay used to produce terracotta pottery on a potter’s wheel. The potter at a full tilt rotates the wheel
        with his hands and gives the ball of clay a shape. The pot or object, after being left to dry is kept on top of combustible materials
         in a pit and fired. Mostly charcoal, wood or coconut shells are used for firing and the temperatures may range from 600 to 1000 deg C.
          The process is complete only after the pottery has been baked for more than two hours to ensure it is hard, strong and durable.</p>

        <p>Terracotta is the term normally used for sculpture made in earthenware, and also for various practical uses including vessels 
          (notably flower pots), water and waste water pipes, roofing tiles, bricks, and surface embellishment in building construction.It is
           usually made from a fairly coarse, porous type of clay. This is first shaped (or sculpted), then fired until hard. In the ancient
            world, it was left to harden in the hot sun; later, it was baked in primitive ovens created in the ashes of open fires.</p>

        <h4 class="media-heading">TERRACOTTA TILES </h4>
        <p > Terracotta translates from Italian as "baked earth," and as a category of ceramic tile, it refers to tiles created from a 
          particularly porous and easily shaped clay with a high iron content that gives the tiles their characteristic reddish/brown color.
          Terracotta is a strong, durable material that is also naturally resistant to mold and bacteria. These tiles can last for decades 
          when they’re installed properly! Because they are naturally porous, these tiles should be professionally sealed to hold up against 
          stains, scratches, and moisture.</p>

        <p>Architectural terracotta refers to a fired mixture of clay and water that can be used in a non-structural, semi-structural,
           or structural capacity on the exterior or interior of a building. Terracotta pottery, as earthenware is called when not used for 
           vessels, is an ancient building material that translates from Latin as "baked earth". Some architectural terracotta is actually the 
           stronger stoneware. It can be unglazed, painted, slip glazed, or glazed. A piece of terracotta is composed of a hollow clay web 
           enclosing a void space or cell. The cell can be installed in compression with mortar or hung with metal anchors. All cells are 
           partially backfilled with mortar.</p>
